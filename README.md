## Project Description
To run the code, run the main.cpp file. When prompted ("Please enter the name of an anime), type in the title of an anime that you like/have seen. The list of recommended anime will show up. After this, you will be prompted to either load more recommendations, input a new anime, or quit the program. For more recommendations, input "more." To get another list based on another input anime, input "new." To quit the program, input "quit."
